the state.json file is acting as the API....it matches any letter typed unto the input with the name of the state matching with it (for example if i input "m" it will return states that starts with "m" with their abbreviation and logitude and latitude as it is in the json  file
Now i want to make the output clickable in the sense that i can be able to use the clicked state latitude and longitude
